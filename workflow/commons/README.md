# DataStax Bulk Loader Workflow Commons

Workflows form a pluggable abstraction that allows DSBulk to execute virtually any kind of 
operation.

This module contains common base classes for workflows, and especially configuration utilities 
shared by DSBulk's built-in workflows (load, unload and count).
