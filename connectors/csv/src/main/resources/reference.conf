  # The URL of the resource(s) to read.
  # This setting has no default value and must be supplied by the user.
  # Which protocols are available depend on which URL stream handlers
  # have been installed, but at least one protocol is guaranteed to be supported:
  # - file:  the file protocol can be used with all supported file systems, local or not;
  #          it also supports reading from a single file, or all files from a directory;
  #          in case of a directory, the "pattern" setting can be used to filter files to read,
  #          and the "recursive" setting can be used to control whether or
  #          not the connector should look for files in subdirectories as well.
  #          Example: url = "file:///path/to/dir/or/file"
  url = null

  # The glob pattern to use when searching for files to read.
  # The syntax to use is the glob syntax, as described in
  # java.nio.file.FileSystem.getPathMatcher().
  # Only applicable when the "url" setting points to a directory
  # on a known filesystem, ignored otherwise.
  pattern = "**/*.csv"

  # Whether to scan for files in subdirectories of the root directory.
  # Only applicable when the "url" setting points to a directory
  # on a known filesystem, ignored otherwise.
  # Defaults to false.
  recursive = false

  # The maximum number of reading threads.
  # In other words, this setting controls how many files
  # can be read simultaneously.
  # Only applicable when the "url" setting points to a directory
  # on a known filesystem, ignored otherwise.
  maxThreads = 4

  # The file encoding to use.
  # Note that this setting applies to all files to be read.
  encoding = "UTF-8"

  # Whether the files to read begin with a header line or not.
  # Defaults to false (no header line).
  # When set to true, the first line in every file is discarded,
  # even if the "linesToSkip" setting is set to zero (see below).
  # However, that line will be used to assign field names to
  # each record, thus allowing mappings by field name such
  # as "{ myFieldName1 = myColumnName1, myFieldName2 = myColumnName2 }".
  # When set to false, records will not contain field names,
  # only (zero-based) field indexes; in this case,
  # the statement mapping should be index-based, such
  # as in "{ 0 = myColumnName1, 1 = myColumnName2}".
  # Note that this setting applies to all files to be read.
  header = false

  # The character to use as field delimiter.
  # Defaults to ',' (comma).
  # Only one character can be specified.
  # Note that this setting applies to all files to be read.
  delimiter = ","

  # The character used for quoting fields when the field delimiter is part of the field value.
  # Defaults to '"' (double quote).
  # Only one character can be specified.
  # Note that this setting applies to all files to be read.
  quote = "\""

  # The character used for escaping quotes inside an already quoted value.
  # Defaults to '\' (backslash).
  # Only one character can be specified.
  # Note that this setting applies to all files to be read.
  escape = "\\"

  # The character that represents a line comment when found in the beginning of a line of text.
  # Defaults to '\0', which disables this feature.
  # Only one character can be specified.
  # Note that this setting applies to all files to be read.
  comment = "\u0000"

  # Defines a number of lines to skip from each input file before the parser can begin to execute.
  # Defaults to zero (i.e., do not skip any lines)
  # Note that this setting applies to each input file individually.
  linesToSkip = 0

  # Defines the maximum number of lines to read from each input file.
  # All lines past this number will be discarded.
  # Defaults to -1, which disables this feature.
  # Note that this setting applies to each input file individually.
  maxLines = -1
